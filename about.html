<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! My name is Giorgi, and I'm a 25-year-old individual with a passion for exploration and creativity. Having completed my schooling and specialized courses in tourism, I've always been fascinated by the idea of discovering new places and cultures.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm immersing myself in the world of web development, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in this rapidly evolving field. The intricacies of coding and design fuel my curiosity, pushing me to create digital experiences that are both functional and visually engaging.

  In addition to my technical pursuits, I'm also deeply committed to personal growth and well-being. Every morning, you'll find me dedicating time to training and exercise, a routine that instills discipline and resilience in both my physical and mental realms.</p>

<p>Beyond the realms of technology and tourism, I find solace and inspiration in the realm of art. Painting has been a cherished hobby of mine, allowing me to express myself creatively and explore the depths of imagination.

  Drawing from my experiences in the hospitality industry, where I've served as both a bartender and supervisor, I've honed valuable skills in communication, teamwork, and leadership. These experiences have shaped me into someone who values genuine connections and strives to create positive experiences for those around me.</p>
<p>In essence, I see myself as a dynamic individual with a diverse range of interests and experiences. Whether I'm crafting code, exploring new destinations, or bringing colors to life on canvas, I approach each endeavor with enthusiasm, curiosity, and a drive to learn and grow.

  Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I'm excited about the journey ahead and the opportunities that await!</p>  <h1>Contact Me</h1>
